**Features**

- Property Listings: Browse and search for properties with filters like price, location, and property type.
- Property Details: View detailed information about each property, including images, descriptions, and pricing.
- Interactive Maps: Visualize property locations using Google Maps, with integration via react-google-maps/api.
- Content Management: Manage property data using HyGraph CMS, with seamless content delivery through GraphQL.

**Technologies Used**

- Next.js: For server-side rendering and building the React front-end.
- HyGraph CMS: Headless CMS for managing property data.
- GraphQL: For efficient data querying and manipulation.
- CSS: Styling the user interface.
- react-google-maps/api: For integrating Google Maps to display property locations.


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
